# Preview Textarea

Generates a live preview lightbox of the formatted version of a textarea while editing an entry.

I've tested this extension with Symphony's default textarea field as well as Rowan's [text box](https://github.com/rowan-lewis/textboxfield) field. If you encounter issues with other textarea fields, please let me know.

## Installation & Use

You can always install the latest version through git: `git clone git://github.com/tachyondecay/preview_textarea.git`

- Make sure that the extension is in a folder named `preview_textarea`. Upload this to your Symphony `extensions` folder.
- Enable the extension from the **Extensions** page in the Symphony backend.
- On the publishing page for a section, textareas will now have a `Preview` link next to their labels. This link will generate a formatted version of the textarea's content and display it as a preview lightbox.
